The idea was to make planting corn seeds as simple, efficient, and regular as possible. This one-handed device made a small hole in the soil and deposited a seed in one motion. With a corn planter like this, a farmer could plant 2-4 acres a day, instead of only 1 acre using traditional tools.","PhotoUrl":"https://brandplayer-prod-filesbucket-458964701190.s3.amazonaws.com/f1bbae58-61d7-48d2-9ec9-47dbd463eca9/b54cbd2adeabbc069b0d8a4e5782caa94a6f04f21f6e2fe46dc91b7211005e61.png","Year":"circa 1900","createdAt":"2024-08-05T16:20:53.332Z","updatedAt":"2024-08-28T19:41:26.894Z","publishedAt":"2024-08-05T16:25:12.187Z","Interactive":false,"GRPMUrl":"https://www.grpmcollections.org/Detail/objects/44304","RealImageUrl":"https://www.grpmcollections.org/media/collectiveaccess/images/1/8/1/6/46611_ca_object_representations_media_181629_large.jpg","InteractiveUrl":null}},{"id":7,"attributes":{"Name":"Midland Painted Turtle (mount)","Description":null,"PhotoUrl":"https://brandplayer-prod-filesbucket-458964701190.s3.amazonaws.com/f1bbae58-61d7-48d2-9ec9-47dbd463eca9/82e6ffb7c5e77d0bd5e719f71684adfc439df604d44bf520ca930ec0331af1f0.png","Year":null,"createdAt":"2024-08-05T16:20:58.465Z","updatedAt":"2024-08-28T19:41:47.433Z","publishedAt":"2024-08-05T16:25:30.443Z","Interactive":false,"GRPMUrl":"https://grpmcollections.org/Detail/objects/97957","RealImageUrl":"https://grpmcollections.org/media/collectiveaccess/images/1/7/3/6/9069_ca_object_representations_media_173612_large.jpg","InteractiveUrl":null}},{"id":8,"attributes":{"Name":"Log-Marking Hammer","Description":"This log-marking hammer has a wood handle and a cast iron head with the letters AF in relief.
